      <p className="tile-content">My vision and dream is to empower communities of color through social media, and internet technologies. my objective is to help unlock the talent and leadership potential that all people possess. Science is a tool of liberation that disenfranchised communities have to utilize to transform society and create social justice. Communities of color may be poor in resources but they are not poor in creativity, talent or the desire to achieve great things. Social media is a revolutionary tool that grows and develops daily. Communities of color must not only join this revolution, but must lead it from the grassroots to the heads of organizations and institutions. In order to join the global community, people who have been marginalized and excluded must fight for a seat at the table. its more important where youâ€™re going than where you come from, and my plan is to show how science is the pathway to equality, liberation and social justice.
