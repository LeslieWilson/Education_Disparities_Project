    <p>As a bilingual hispanic woman, I can say that computer science is like learning any other language. The earlier you start the easier it is for you to learn, and the more you learn the easier it is to learn other languages. Just as it opens doors to many opportunities for communication and exploration, coding makes things accessible that, long term, influence what children do later in life. It is only fair that we have equal access to these resources, and that there is community awareness around this issue.
