      <p>Ive always been interested in technology but growing up in working immigrant household, it was hard to gain access to the tech I'd want to work with. In school there wasn't much offered as far as computer sciences and technology maybe a typing course or two but nothing more. Now that technology is rapidly being integrated into everyday life its important that the schools implement a curriculum that adheres to the blossoming tech industry. Elementary to collegiate level institutions can offer the appropriate course curriculum  that helps students gain the skills required to thrive in the tech oriented industry
